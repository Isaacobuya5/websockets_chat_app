WebSocket
-> Is a protocol that is used to create real time applications with nodejs.
-> Can be used with any programming language
-> used to set up real time communications.
-> We create a server then multiple clients can connect to that server.
-> Can be used to achieve what is known as a full duplex communication i.e 
a bi-directional communication which means that a client can initiate communication with the server and the server can initiate 
communication with the client.
-> With web sockets we have a persistent communication which means that the client connects to the server and it stays connected
for as long as it needs to.
-> Is a separate protocol for http.
Socket.io library provides everything we need to work with Web Sockets.
